# Hi there 👋

## Commit and Issue pattern

For commiting and issue creating, we are using the Conventional Commit Pattern allied to Emoji Log, to create more clear explanations about what we aim to develop.

This pattern has the following standard:

```📦 NEW: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when you add something entirely new. E.g. ```📦 NEW```: Add Git ignore file

```👌 IMPROVE: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when you improve/enhance piece of code like refactoring etc. E.g. ```👌 IMPROVE```: Remote IP API Function

```🐛 FIX: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when you fix a bug — need I say more? E.g. ```🐛 FIX```: Case conversion

```📖 DOC: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when you add documentation like README.md, or even inline docs. E.g. ```📖 DOC```: API Interface Tutorial

```🚀 RELEASE: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when you release a new version. E.g. ```🚀 RELEASE```: Version 2.0.0

```🤖 TEST: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when it's related to testing. E.g. ```🤖 TEST```: Mock User Login/Logout

```‼️ BREAKING: IMPERATIVE_MESSAGE_GOES_HERE```

Use when releasing a change that breaks previous versions. E.g. ```‼️ BREAKING```: Change authentication protocol
